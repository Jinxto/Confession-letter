# Confession-letter
I use java to confess to someone serious

# Sucess Rate
Initially it was zero percent, but with some creativity it became 100% (requires 100% luck)

# Development hours
Since i was in a time constraint, i do not have much time therefore it is 
impossible to confess with alot of if-else without some redundancy. Hence,
i've decided to confess by fowarding my message to the bot to her and forwarding her
message to the bot to me. Which in turn can act as an anonymous sender at some point.
